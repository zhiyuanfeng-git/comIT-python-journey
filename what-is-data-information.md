## What is data and information?

Data and information are related concepts but have distinct meanings.

1. Data:
   * Data refers to the raw,unprocessed facts,symbols,or inputs that lack inherent meaning.
   * It exists in various forms,including numbers,text,images,and audio.
   * Data,in its raw state,lacks organization and interpretation.

2. Information:
   * Information is the meaningful and organized result of processing data.
   * It represents knowledge derived through analysis,providing context,relevance,and purpose.
   * Unlike data,information is valuable for decision-making,as it conveys significance and understanding.
  
In essence,data serves as the raw material,while information is the refined,meaningful output derived from the processing of that data. The transformation from data to information involves adding context and interpretaion.

As a programmer, what is data and information?

As a programmer,data is the value of a variable,or specific data stored in the memory.These individual values,in isolation,often lack inherent meaning or significance.

Conversely,information manifests in the code itself.It serves as the intellectual architecture that interconnects these variables through logical constructs. Through the programmer's logic and instructions, the code empowers the computer to execute precise operations on the data. The intricate rules and structures embedded in the code harmoniously organize disparate data,turn it into coherent and meaningful information.
