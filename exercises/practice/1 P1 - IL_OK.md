## Introduction to logics

1. Mark the link terms (if any) in the following propositions. Find how many atomic propositions are found in each
molecular proposition. Recall that << if ..., then >> is a single link term.
   * This is not my happy day.
      * atomic propositions: [1]
   * Winter has come **and** days are shorter.
      * atomic propositions: [2]
   * Many germs are not bacteria.
      * atomic propositions: [1]
   * **If** there are flaws in large rock masses, **then** earthquakes may occur.
      * atomic propositions: [2]
   * **If** it is a positive number **then** it is greater than zero.
      * atomic propositions: [2]
   * **If** x > 0 **then** y = 2
      * atomic propositions: [2]
   * **If** x + y = 2 **then** z > 0
      * atomic propositions: [2]
   * x = 0 **or** y = 1
      * atomic propositions: [2]
   * * **If** x = 1 **or** z = 2 **then** y > 1
      * atomic propositions: [3]
   * **If** z > 10 **then** “x + z > 10” **and** “y + z > 10”.
       * atomic propositions: [3]
   * x + y = y + x
       * atomic propositions: [1]

2. Recognize the propositional structure of each sentence below, to do so underline the atomic propositions, mark the link terms and group them into molecules.
   * <u>The meal will be today at three o'clock</u>.
   * <u>The big black bear walked lazily down the road</u>.
   * <u>The music is very soft</u> **or** <u>the door is closed</u>.
   * <u>This big dog likes to hunt cats</u>.
   * <u>He asks for his pipe</u> **and** <u>asks for his bowl</u>.
   * <u>**If** John is a good player</u>, **then** <u>he will participate in the school team</u>.
   * <u>Older students are not on the list before young people</u>.
   * <u>x + y > 2</u>
   * <u>x = 1</u> **or** <u>y + z = 2</u>
   * <u>y = 2</u> **and** <u>z = 10</u>
   * <u>A better world has no pollution</u>
   * <u>Democracy only exists</u> if **and** only <u>if there are elections</u>
   * <u>To defeat Voldemort</u>, <u>Harry needs to destroy the Horcruxes</u>.
   * <u>To defeat Voldemort</u>, <u>Harry destroyed the Horcruxes</u>.
   * <u>**If** I collect wood</u> **then** <u>I can build a ship</u> **and** <u>thus sail across the Atlantic</u>.
   * <u>Since I collect wood</u> <u>then I can build a boat</u> **and**, <u>**if** I build a boat</u> **then** <u>I sail to the other side of the Atlantic</u>.

3. Idem previous exercise, only use parentheses to show the structure of the following molecular propositions.
   * (John is here) **and** (Mary has left).
   * **If** (x + 1 = 10) **then** (x = 9).
   * (Mary is not here) **or** (John has left).
   * **If** (x = 1) **or** (y = 2) **then** (z = 3).
   * **If** (Peter is at home) **or** (John is in the courtyard), **then** (Joseph is innocent).
   * (y = 0) **and** (x = 0)
   * (Doesn’t happen that 6 = 7)
   * (Doesn’t happen that) **if** (x + 0 = 10) **then** (x = 5).

4. Let p, q, r, s, t, m, n and v be atomic propositions, to which I assign the following sentences.
p: John traveled in the 8 A.M plane.
q: Peter arrived on time to the airport.
r: The project was presented to the board of directors.
s: The flight was delayed
t: Peter travels on the plane
m: “x + y = 0”; 
n: “x = 2”; 
v: “y = -2”
Interpret the molecular propositions formed. That is, express in natural language the following propositions. Group by using parentheses to better recognize the precedence of operators and form a sentence.
   * q -> ~p
     **If** (John traveled in the 8 A.M plane), **then** **it isn't the case that** (Peter arrived on time to the airport).
   * (p ^ s) -> t
     **If** (John traveled in the 8 A.M plane) **and** (the flight was delayed), **then** (Peter travels on the plane)
   * ~q -> (~r ^ ~p )
     **If** **it isn't the case that** (Peter arrived on time to the airport),**then** ((**it isn't the case that** The project was presented to the board of directors) **and** (**it also isn't the case that** John traveled in the 8 A.M plane)).
   * (n ^ ñ) -> n
     **If** (x=2) **and** x **not**= 2, **then** (x=2)
