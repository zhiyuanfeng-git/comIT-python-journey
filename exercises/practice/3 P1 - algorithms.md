## Algorithms

1. Answering the following questions.
   * What is a problem?
     * Origin
       * Late 14c.,probleme,"a difficult question proposed for discussion or solution; a riddle; or a scientific topic for investigation," from Old French problème (14c.)
       * Directly from Latin problema,from Greek problēma,"a task, that which is proposed,a question;",literally "thing put forward".
     * Definitions [noun]
       * a qustion raised for consideration or solution
       * a source of difficulty
       * a state of difficulty that needs to be resolved
     * Problems in computer science
       * A problem in computer science refers to a changing task or question that requires investigation,analysis,and the development of a solution through computational methods.
       * The specific task or difficulty that needs to be addressed using computational thinking and algorithmic solutions. It may involve designing efficient algorithms,developing software applications,optimizing processes,or solving complex computational puzzles.
   * Is it important to describe the context in which I am to solve it?
      * Yes,describing the context in which a problem needs to be solved is crucial. The context provides the necessary background information,constraints,and relevant details that help in understanding the problem more comprehensively. It allows for a more accurate analysis and helps in tailoring the solution to the specific circumstances.
   * How do you call the facts that we enuciate to complete the understanding of the problem?
     * The facts enunciated to complete the understanding of a problem are often referred to as "contextual information" or "relevant details". These facts provide additional insights into the situation,helping to clarify the problem,its scope,and the potential impact of various factors involved.
   * Is the problem the same for all people who analyze it? Why?
    * In computer science, I think the problem may be is same for almost all people due to the problems in computer science always are certain. but the interpretation of a problem may vary for individuals and the analysis of a problem or the solution for the specific problem is also different for individuals. Due to individuals are different in background and perspectives.

2. List the steps required to resolve the following situations
   * Prepare and eat a fried egg.
     * get eggs with specific count
     * get a bowl
     * crack the eggs one by one in a bowl
     * add seasonings to the bowl
     * get blender
     * stir the eggs in the bowl
     * get a plate
     * get the pot
     * put the pot on the stove
     * put oil in the pot
     * turn on the fire
     * wait until the oil is hot
     * put the stirred eggs into the pot
     * get spatula
     * scrambled eggs with a spatula
     * put the scrambled eggs on a plate
     * get cutlery and put the plates on the table
     * sit on the chair and start eating eggs
     * clean up the kitchen after eating
3. Explain the steps you normally take to solve a problem
   * what is the problem? please decribe the problem detailed
   * understand the context in which the problem occurred
   * try to further understand the problem from different perspectives
   * break down the problem into smaller pieces
   * find a few suitable solutions for each part
   * verify and choose the best solution for the entire problem
   * record the problem and the process of solving this problem
4. A man found to fly in his coffee and sent his coffee back to the kitchen.When the waiter returned with a new cup of coffee,the man took a sip and immediately knew that the waiter had just removed the fly and given him back the same cup of coffee.How did the man know that he was not served a fresh cup of coffee?
   * The cup of coffee given him back is not hot as the new coffee.
   * There's the same amount of coffee in both cups.
   * The lip mark on the cup is still there.

5. Some months have 31 days, others have 30, how many have 28?
   * Consider the nature of months and their varying lengths.
   * You can also iterate all the months of the year and see how many days those months have.
   * Finally, you will recognize that all months have at least 28 days.
   * After verifying, you will find that February is the month most commonly associated with having 28 days.This fact is that except for leap months,February has only 28 days every year.

6. A man is trapped in a room. The room has only two possible exits: two doors. Through the first door there is a room constructed from magnifying glass. The blazing hot sun instantly fries anything or anyone that enters. Through the second door there is a fire-breathing dragon. How does the man escape?
   * Go through the first door: wait until nightfall or night.
   * Go through the second door: kill the dragon if you have a weapon or something that can have enough power to let you kill the dragon.
