# Algorithms

1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of modular programming. Explain in words how to model with modules a problem where you have to read from the keyboard a series of numbers (which can be stored in a list) and display the 3 major numbers and 3 minor ones.

   When you use modularity to structure your programming, every module is responsible for a specific task, there are many advantages, such as easier to reusable, maintain, extend, and integrate. But as the modules become more and more, it becomes more complexity that how to communicate with modules and how to integrate modules. The dependencies are more complex. Such as in python, we need to many package management tools to manage the different modules and their dependencies.

   Designing modules to resolve the problem, can be separated into some modules as follows:
   * Input module
     * Responsible for managing the data user inputs,and
     * Other modules can access these data after importing this module
   * Showing module
     * Accountable for arranging or sorting the data
     * Showcasing different numbers by different conditions.
     * It may consist of two child modules,such as the showing module and the condition module.
2. Count the number of words, separated by one or more spaces, from a telegram ending in point. It can be
assumed that the user enters character by character the telegram or the complete sequence, which is more
comfortable to propose a solution.
    ```
    function count_words()
        local sentence = input("Please enter a complete sentence:")
        local letter_count = 0
        local word_count = 0
        for local i = 0; i less than sentence.length; i++:
            local char = sentence[i]
            if letter_count == 0 then
                if char != ' ' then
                    letter_count = letter_count + 1
                end if
            else
                if char == ' ' then
                    word_count = word_count + 1
                    letter_count = 0
                else
                    letter_count = letter_count + 1
                end
            end if
        end for
    end
    ```
3. Given the following algorithms:
    ```
    algorithm a1
        var Number : x
        x <- 10
        print (x * 5)
        x <- a2(x*2)
        x <- x * 2
        a2(x)
    end algorithm

    algorithm a2(Number : x) : Number
        print (x)
        x <- x / 2
        print (x)
        return x
    end algorithm
    ```
    Identify the scopes of each variable. Track the execution of a1 indicating what is displayed by console. Idem for the
execution (independently) of the algorithm a2.
    * The variable 'x' in a1 is a local variable in a1.
    * The parameter 'x' in a2 only can access inside of the function of a2.
    * a1 would print on the console:
      * 50
      * 20
      * 10
      * 20
      * 10
    * a2 would print on the console:
      * 20
      * 10
4. Develop an algorithm for a dice game. The player must bet on a number between 1 and 6 (keyboard reading),
then you must simulate the roll of a dice and finally inform the player if he has won or lost (print on screen).

    ```
    function random_once()
        local result = random(1,6)
        return result
    end

    function check_valid(number)
        if ((result less than 1) or (result greater than 6) )
            return false
        end if
        return true
    end

    function get_user_bet()
        local result = int(input("Please input a number between 1 and 6:))
        if (not check_valid(result))
            return -1
        end if
        return result
    end

    function is_win(random,bet)
        if random == bet then
            return true
        end if
        return false
    end

    function do_game(bet)
        local rand_number = random_once()
        local is_win = is_win(rand_number,bet)
        if is_win:
            print("You won the game.")
        else
            print("You lost!")
        end if
    end

    function main()
        local bet = 0
        while true:
            local _bet = get_user_bet()
            if (not check_valid(bet))
                print("The number you inputted is not valid. Please enter again.")
            else
                bet = _bet
                break
            end if
        end while
    do_game(bet)
    end
    ```
5. Write an algorithm to invert a string of characters.
   ```
    function invert_string(source_string)
        local length = source_string.length
        if length less than 1 then return null end

        local result_string = '';
        for(local i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            result_string += source_string[i]
        end for
    end
   ```
6. Explain what the following algorithm performs
    algorithm toInt (String : cad)
        var Number : long,i <- 0,pot <- 1,res <- 0
        var String : c
        long <- length (cad)
        while (i < long) do
            c <- charIn(cad,long - i - 1)
            res <- res + ord(c) * pot
            pot <- pot * 10
            i <- i + 1
        end while
        return res
    end algorithm
    Where ord is a function that receives a character and returns its value in numeric format. This way it is compatible to work with arithmetic operations.

    The algorithm effectively performs the operation of converting a string into an integer.

7. Propose a modular solution to the problem of determining if a number is prime.
   * Data module
     * responsible for getting a number
     * the number can come from the number that the user inputted or that is reading from a file.
   * Check module
     * perform is_prime algorithm
   * print module
     * print the result to console or a file
   * Main module
     * start the program
     * getting a number from data module
     * determine if the number is a prime by check module
     * print the result by print module
8. Write a sub-algorithm that has a parameter of type number that represents a year and determines whether the year is leap year or not.
   ```
    function is_leap_year(year)
        if year % 4 equals to 0 then
            if (year % 100) != 0 or (year % 400) == 0 then
                return true
            end
        end if
        return false
    end
   ```
9. Write a sub-algorithm to determine the number of days of a month of a year, the latter two parameters of the sub-algorithm.

    ```
     function get_days_month(month,year)
        if month equals to 2 then
            if is_leap_year(year) then
                return 29
            else
                return 28
            end if
        else if month in [1,3,5,7,8,10,12] then
            return 31
        end if month in [4,6,9,11] then
            return 30
        end if
        raise Exception("Invalid month")
     end
    ```
10. A meteorological station collects rain data for a month and year of a determined locality. An algorithm must be written asking the user to enter a month and a year, and allow for each day of that month in that year, enter the millimeters of water that were recorded (in case of not having registered a rain one day is entered 0) . The amount of total millimeters of water precipitated in that month must be shown, the maximum precipitation recorded for a day and on what day it was given, and finally if it rained two days in a row.
    ```
        function calculate_rain_data()
            month = int(input("Please enter the month:"))
            year = int(input("Please enter the year:"))

            days_in_month = get_days_month(month,year)

            total_amount = 0
            max_amount = 0
            max_day = 0
            previous_amount = 0
            is_continues_two_days = false

            for (local i = 1; i less than and equals to days_in_month)
                rain_amount = float(input("Please enter the amount for the day {i}: "))
                total_amount = total_amount + rain_amount

                if rain_amount greater than max_amount then
                    max_amount = rain_amount
                    max_day = i
                end if
                
                if rain_amount greater than 0 and previous_amount greater than 0 then
                    is_continues_two_days = true
                end

                previous_amount = rain_amount
            end for

            print("The total amount for the month {month} is {total_amount}")
            print("The maximum amount is {max_amount} on day {max_day}")
            if is_continues_two_days then
                print("It rained two days in a row.")
            else
                print("It did't rain two days in a row.")
            end
        end
    ```
