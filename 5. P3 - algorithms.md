# Algorithms

1. What are the differences and similarities between an identifier and a reserved word.
   * Identifiers are names you make up for things in your program like variables or functions.
   * Reserved words are special words that already have meanings in the programming language and can't be used as identifiers.
   * Both identifiers and reserved words are essential components of a programming language's syntax,but they serve different purposes and follow different rules.
2. Create an algorithm to determine the largest of 3 number.
   ```
   function find_largest_number(num1,num2,num3)
        local ret_num = num1
        if num2 greater than ret_num then
            ret_num = num2
        end if
        if num3 greater than ret_num then
            ret_num = num3
        end if
        return ret_num
   end
   ```
3. Create an algorithm to determine the largest of a series of numbers that are read from the keyboard. The user ends by entering -1.

    ```
    function find_largest_number()
        local largest_num = decimal.NegativeMinValue
        while true:
            try:
                local input_num = decimal(input("Enter a number (-1 to end): "))

                if input_num equals to -1 then
                    break
                end
                
                if num greater than largest_num then
                    largest_num = num
                end
            except DecimalError:
                print("Please enter a valid number.")

        end while
        return largest_num
    end
    ```
4. Write an algorithm to determine the least of a series of numbers that are read from the keyboard. The user ends by entering -1. What differences do you find with respect to the previous algorithm?
   ```
   function find_least_number()
        local least_num = decimal.PositiveMaxValue
        while true:
            try:
                local input_num = decimal(input("Enter a number (-1 to end): "))

                if input_num equals to -1 then
                    break
                end

                if num less than least_num then
                    least_num = num
                end
            except:
                print("Please enter a valid number.")
        end while

        return least_num
   end
   ```
   There are two differences between this algorithm and previous algorithm.
   * The first is about initializing return_value(largest_num and least_num).
     In this algorithm, we initialize the return_value variable with positive max value.
     In the previous algorithm, we initialize the return_value variable with negative min value.
   * The second is about updating the least_num with a more smaller than the current least number.
     In the previous algorithm, we update the largest_num with a more larger that the current largest number.
5. Write an algorithm to print and count the multiples of 3 from 1 to a number that we enter by keyboard.
   ```
    function multiples_3_numbers()
        try:
            local input_num = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
            for(local i = 1; i <= input_num; i++)
                if (i % 3) == 0 then
                    print("the multiples of 3 is : {}",i)
                end if
            end for
            
        except:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")
    end
   ```
6. Write an algorithm that reads a series of real numbers and adds them, printing the result. The series ends when the user enters the number zero
   ```
    function add_real_numbers_inputted()
        local result = 0
        while true:
            local input_num = float(input("please enter a real number(enter 0 to exit):"))
            if input_num not equal 0 then
                result = result + input_num
            else
                break
            end if
        end while
        print("The result of a series of real numbers is {}",result)
    end
   ```
7. Write an algorithm to find the average of a series of numbers that are read from the keyboard. Compare this exercise with the previous one. What are the differences and similarities?
   ```
    function find_average_numbers()
        local result = 0
        local count = 0
        while true:
            local input_number = float(input("please a number(enter 0 to exit):"))
            if input_number not equal 0 then
                result = result + input_number
                count = count + 1
            else
                break
            end if
        end while
        if count > 0 then
            local average = result / count
            print("The average of a series of numbers is {}",average)
        else
            print("There were not valid number inputted")
        end if
    end
   ```
   The primary similarities are as follow:
    * Both algorithms need a loop statement(while loop in this exercise) to reminder the user to input a series of numbers when a specific condition is met.
    * Both algorithms accumulate a sum based on the numbers inputted by the user.
   The primary differences are as follow:
    * The algorithm in 6 only need calculate the sum of a series of numbers and print the result. But this algorithm need to keep track of the count that is used to calculate the average of the numbers.
8. Given a series of real numbers that are being read from the keyboard, determine the maximum value and the position of it.
   ```
    function max_numbers_inputted()
        local max_number = int.MinNumber
        local position = 0
        local max_position = 0
        while true:
            local input_number = int(input("Please enter a number(enter 0 to exit):"))
            if input_number not equal 0 then
                position = position + 1
                if input_number > max_number then
                    max_number = input_number
                    max_position = position
                else
                end if
            else
                break
            end if
        end while
        if max_position != 0 then
            print("The maximum value is {} and the position of it is {}",max_number,max_position)
        else
            print("There were not valid numbers you inputted")
        end
    end
   ```
9. Write an algorithm that requests the reading of a series of individual characters and count how many times the letter "a" is entered. The user ends by entering the "$" symbol.
    ```
     function count_of_characters()
        local a_count = 0
        while true:
            local input_char = char(input("Please enter a char(enter $ to exit):"))
            if input_char not equal '$' then
                if input_char equal 'a' then
                    a_count = a_count + 1
                end if
            else
                break
            end if
        end while

        print("The times of the letter \"a\" is {}",a_count)
     end
    ```
10. Develop an algorithm to count the number of students whose weight is between 50 and 60, between 61 and 80 and between 81 and 100. The weights are entered by keyboard and report the number of students in each category of weight. How does the algorithm change if I want to accumulate weight totals for each category?
    ```
        category_list = []

        function add_category(min,max)
            weight_list = []
            weight_list[0] = min
            weight_list[1] = max
            category_list.push_back(weight_list)
        end

        function get_category_index_by_weight(weight)
            if weight less than and equal 0 then
                return -1
            end
            for local i = 0; i less than category_list.length; i++:
                local list = category_list[i]
                local min = list[0]
                local max = list[1]
                if (weight greater than and equal min) and (weight less than and equal max) then
                    return i
                end
            end for
            return -2
        end

        function calculate_count()
            if category_list.length less than 1 then
                print("There are not any valid category.")
                return
            end
            local numbers_list = []
            while true:
                local input_weight = float(input("Please enter a wight of a student(enter 0 to exit):"))
                if input_weight equal 0 then
                    break
                end if
                local index = get_category_index_by_weight(input_weight)
                if index greater than and equal 0 then
                    if not number_list[index] then
                        number_list[index] = 0
                    end if
                    number_list[index] = number_list[index] + 1
                end
            end while
            return number_list
        end

        function print_students_of_category(student_list)
            for local i = 0; i less than student_list.length; i++:
                local weight_list = category_list[i]
                local min = weight_list[0]
                local max = weight_list[1]
                local count = student_list[i]
                print("The count of students between {} and {} is {}",min,max,count)
            end for
        end

        function main()
            add_category(50,60)
            add_category(61,80)
            add_category(81,100)
            local number_list = calculate_count()
            print_students_of_category(student_list)
        end
    ```
    We can do the following change to adapt to the new algorithm that wants to accumulate weight totals for each category.
     * In calculate_count function, we can store a list or a class in the numbers_list.
     * If a list, the element of index 0 represents the count of students. The element of index 1 represents the total weights.
     * If a class, the class has two attributes that one is the count of students, another is the total weights.
     * And then, When you iterate the input_weight, you can calculate the two elements or attributes.
11. Write an algorithm to determine if a number read by keyboard is prime.
    * What is a prime number?
      * A prime number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1 without remainders.
    ```
        function is_prime(number)
            if number less than 2 then
                return false
            end
            for (local i = 2; i less than (math.sqrt(number) + 1); i++)
                if number % i == 0 then
                    return false
                end if
            end
            return true
        end
        input_number = int(input(please a number:))
        print(is_prime(input_number))
    ```
12. Write an algorithm to print and count numbers that are multiples of 2 or 3 that are between 1 and 100.
    ```
    function print_count_numbers_of_2or3(min,max)
        local count = 0
        for (local i = min; i less than and equals max; i++)
            if (i % 2) == 0 or (i % 3) == 0 then
                count = count + 1
                print(f"count = {0},number = {1}",count,i)
            end
        end
    end
    local min = 1
    local max = 100
    print_count_numbers_of_2or3(min,max)
    ```
13. Develop an algorithm to determine if a series of numbers that the user is entering is in increasing order or not.
    ```
     function is_increasing()
        local last_number = 0
        local is_increasing = false
        while true:
            input_number = float(input("Please a number(enter 0 to exit):))
            if input_number equals 0 then
                break
            end
            if input_number less than and equals last_number then
                is_increasing = false
                break
            end
            last_number = input_number
            is_increasing = true
        end while
        print(is_increasing)
     end
    ```
